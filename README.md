# MacEtchBandAlign: Semiconductor & Catalyst Band Alignment Visualizer

**MacEtchBandAlign** is a cross-platform desktop application for plotting valence bands, conduction bands, work functions, and oxidation potentials of semiconductors and catalyst materials.

It includes a simple GUI, customizable material entry, and dynamic plotting of selected materials.

---

## üß∞ Features

- Visualize semiconductor and metal energy levels relative to NHE and vacuum
- Enable/disable plotting of work function or oxidation potential per material
- Add custom semiconductors, metals, and oxidants from the GUI
- Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux (coming soon!) binaries
